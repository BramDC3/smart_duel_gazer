# Smart Duel Gazer

Smart Duel Gazer (SDG) is a Unity application used for playing the popular TCG named Yu-Gi-Oh!. It is an extension to the [Smart Duel Disk][Smart Duel Disk].

## How does it work?

Let's say you summon a Blue-Eyes White Dragon in the Smart Duel Disk (SDD). The SDD will then send an event to the Smart Duel Gazer (SDG) to let it know that a BEWD has been summoned. The user performs the action using the SDD and the SDG will visualise this action.

The SDD runs on an Android/iOS device and is something you wear on your arm, like a duel disk. The SDG runs on AR glasses / an AR headset / Google Cardboard / ... which is something you wear on your head.

## Which AR glasses / AR headsets are supported?

We're currently looking into running the app on an Android device and integrate the Google Cardboard API to let the user wear their device on their head. We thought about programming for the HoloLens but it's too expensive for consumers. The Oculus Quest 2 will get AR support later this year, we'll definitely look into it. AR glasses would be idea, but those don't exist yet. We'll have to wait until 2023/2024 for this technology to become available.

## How to install the app?

The app is currently in a very experimental stage so you can't download the app yet.
